    "## 📌 **Notebook Highlights**   \n",
    "✔️ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "   - 📊 Survival rates based on **Pclass, Age, Gender, Family Size, Fare, Embarkation Port**  \n",
    "   - 📉 Interactive **Plotly visualizations with dark backgrounds**  \n",
    "✔️ **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   - 🔹 Extracted **Cabin Letter** (First-class passengers had a better survival rate)  \n",
    "   - 🔹 Extracted **Ticket Prefix** (Linked to passenger wealth)  \n",
    "   - 🔹 Created **Family Size** (Passengers with small families had higher survival rates)  \n",
    "   - 🔹 Applied **Log Transformation on Fare** to reduce skewness  \n",
    "✔️ **Machine Learning with PyCaret**\n",
    "   - 🏆 **AutoML Setup:** Handled categorical & numerical features automatically  \n",
    "   - 🔍 **Compare Models:** Selected the best model  \n",
    "   - 🔧 **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Improved accuracy  \n",
