    "**Author:** Muhammad Hassan Saboor  \n",
    "**Date Created:** February 2025  \n",
    "**Last Updated:** February 2025  \n",
    "**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Plotly, Statsmodels, PyCaret  \n",
    "**Objective:** To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Alibaba stock data, uncover key insights, apply machine learning for predictive modeling, and visualize stock-related metrics.  \n",

    "## 🔍 **Actions Performed in this Notebook**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  \n",
    "   - Loaded Alibaba stock data.  \n",
    "   - Converted the `Date` column to datetime format for time-series analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **General Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Summary statistics for key columns.  \n",
    "   - Identification of outliers in stock prices and trading volume.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Trend Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Analyzed yearly and monthly trends in adjusted close prices.  \n",
    "   - Investigated volatility patterns and trading volume across time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correlations**  \n",
    "   - Studied correlations between stock prices (**High, Low, Open, Close, Adj Close**).  \n",
    "   - Analyzed relationships between **Volume** and price changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Metrics**  \n",
    "   - Calculated **daily percentage changes** and identified best/worst performing days.  \n",
    "   - Visualized **moving averages** (50-day, 100-day, 200-day).  \n",
    "   - Analyzed **price spread** between High and Low prices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Comparative Analysis**  \n",
    "   - Investigated **Open vs. Close** price relationships.  \n",
    "   - Examined how often **Close price is close to High/Low prices**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Key Events**  \n",
    "   - Identified **peaks and troughs** in adjusted close prices.  \n",
    "   - Investigated days with **unusually high trading volume**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Visualization Insights**  \n",
    "   - Created **candlestick charts** for detailed stock movements.  \n",
    "   - Overlaid **trading volume** on price movements.  \n",
    "   - Generated **heatmaps** for monthly/weekly performance trends.  \n",
    "   - Plotted **rolling standard deviation** to capture volatility.  \n",
    "   - Visualized **Volume vs. price changes** using scatter plots.  \n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Seasonality & Day-of-Week Effects**  \n",
    "   - Performed **seasonal decomposition** to analyze trends, seasonality, and residuals.  \n",
    "   - Investigated if certain **days of the week have consistent price patterns**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Machine Learning with PyCaret**  \n",
    "    - Applied **PyCaret’s regression module** to predict **stock closing prices**.  \n",
    "    - Compared multiple ML models, including **Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting**.  \n",
    "    - Selected the best-performing model based on **MAE, RMSE, and R² scores**.  \n",
    "    - **Tuned hyperparameters** to improve prediction accuracy.  \n",
